        <!-- Start ** Introduction ** -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political
  bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the
  separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent respect to
  the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. </p>

<!-- End ** Introduction ** -->
<!-- Start ** The Foundations of Free Government ** -->

<h2>The Foundations of Free Government</h2>

<p> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are
  endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty
  and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving
  their
  just powers from the consent of the governed,--That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of
  these
  ends, it is the
  Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on
  such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
  Safety and Happiness. </p>
<p> Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for
  light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to
  suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are
  accustomed. </p>
<p> But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
  Object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it
  is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. --Such has
  been
  the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the
  necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. </p>

<!-- Start ** Abuses of King George III ** -->
<h2>Abuses of King George III</h2>
<p>
  The history of the present king of Great Britain is a
  history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an
  absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.
  </li>
  <li> He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless
    suspended in their operation till his assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has
    utterly neglected to attend to them. </li>
  <li> He has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless
    those people would relinquish the right of representation in the legislature, a right
    inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. </li>
  <li> He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the
    depository of their public records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance
    with his measures. </li>
  <li> He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly for opposing with manly firmness his
    invasions on the rights of the people. </li>
  <li> He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected;
    whereby the legislative powers, incapable of annihilation, have returned to the
    people at large for their exercise, the state remaining in the meantime exposed to all the dangers of
    invasion from without and convulsions within. </li>
  <li> He has endeavored to prevent the population of these states; for that purpose
    obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners, refusing to pass others to encourage
    their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new appropriations of
    lands. </li>
  <li> He has obstructed the administration of justice by refusing his assent to laws for establishing
    judiciary powers. </li>
  <li> He has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their offices and the
    amount and payment of their salaries. </li>
  <li> He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our
    people and eat out their substance. </li>
  <li> He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies without the consent of our legislatures. </li>
  <li> He has affected to render the military independent of and superior to the
    civil power. </li>
  <li> He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our
    constitution and unacknowledged by our laws, giving his assent to their acts of pretended
    legislation: <ul>
      <li> For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us; </li>
      <li> For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders which they should commit on
        the inhabitants of these states; </li>
      <li> For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world; </li>
      <li> For imposing taxes on us without our consent; </li>
      <li> For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury; </li>
      <li> For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended offenses; </li>
      <li> For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring province,
        establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries so as
        to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into
        these colonies; </li>
      <li> For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws, and altering
        fundamentally the forms of our governments; </li>
      <li> For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves invested
        with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> He has abdicated government here by declaring us out of his protection and waging
    war against us. </li>
  <li> He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our
    people. </li>
  <li> He is at this time transporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death,
    desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely
    paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the head of a civilized nation.
  </li>
  <li> He has constrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high seas to bear arms
    against their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren or to fall
    themselves by their hands. </li>
  <li> He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavored to bring on
    the inhabitants of our frontiers the merciless Indian savages, whose known rule of warfare
    is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes, and conditions. </li>
</ol>

<!-- Start ** Efforts to Obtain Justice from Great Britain III ** -->

<h2>Efforts to Obtain Justice from Great Britain</h2>
<p> In every stage of these oppressions, we have petitioned for redress in
  the most humble terms; our repeated petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A prince
  whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the
  ruler of a free people. </p>
<p> Nor have we been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned
  them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction
  over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We
  have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our
  common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections
  and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We
  must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separation, and hold them, as we hold
  the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends. </p>

<h2>Birth of the American Nation</h2>
<p> We, therefore, the representatives of the United States of America, in
  general Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of
  our intentions, do, in the name and by authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly
  publish and declare that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
  states; that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all political
  connection between them and the state of Great Britain is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that, as
  free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract
  alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent states may
  of right do. </p>
<p> And for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on
  the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our
  sacred honor. </p>

    hundred and eighty nine.</p>
<p class="center">THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting
    the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further

    Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.</p>
<p class="center">RESOLVED by the Senate and
    House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses
    concurring, that the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to
    the Constitution of the United States, all, or any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said
    Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution; viz.

    Representatives. Sam. A. Otis Secretary of the Senate. *On September 25, 1789, Congress transmitted to the state
    legislatures twelve proposed amendments, two of which, having to do with Congressional representation and
    Congressional pay, were not adopted. The remaining ten amendments became the Bill of Rights.</p>

                requisition shall be binding, and thereupon the legislature of each state shall appoint the
                regimental officers, raise the men and cloth, arm and equip them in a soldier like manner, at the

                unless the legislature of such sta te shall judge that such extra number cannot be safely spared out
                of the same, in which case they shall raise officer, cloath, arm and equip as many of such extra
                number as they judge can be safely spared. And the officers and men so cloathed, armed and equipped,
