                if the united states in congress assembled shall, on consideration of circumstances judge proper
                that any state should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number than its quota, and that any
                other state should raise a greater number of men than the quota thereof, such extra number shall be
                raised, officered, cloathed, armed and equipped in the same manner as the quota of such state,
                unless the legislature of such sta te shall judge that such extra number cannot be safely spared out
                of the same, in which case they shall raise officer, cloath, arm and equip as many of such extra
                number as they judge can be safely spared. And the officers and men so cloathed, armed and equipped,
                shall march to the place appointed, and within the time agreed on by the united states in congress
                assembled.</p>

                commander in chief of the army or navy, unless nine states assent to the same: nor shall a
                question on any other point, except for adjourning from day to day be determined, unless by the
                votes of a majority of the united states in congress assembled.</p>
            <p> The congress of the united
                states shall have power to adjourn to any time within the year, and to any place within the
                united states, so that no period of adjournment be for a longer duration than the space of
                six Months, and shall publish the Journal of their proceedings monthly, except such parts
                thereof relating to treaties, alliances or military operations, as in their judgment require
                secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the delegates of each state on any question shall be
                entered on the Journal, when it is desired by any delegate; and the delegates of a state, or
                any of them, at his or their request shall be furnished with a transcript of the said
                Journal, except such parts as are above excepted, to lay before the legislatures of the
                several states.</p>
