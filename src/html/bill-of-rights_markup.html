    hundred and eighty nine.</p>
<p class="center">THE Conventions of a number of the States, having at the time of their adopting
    the Constitution, expressed a desire, in order to prevent misconstruction or abuse of its powers, that further
    declaratory and restrictive clauses should be added: And as extending the ground of public confidence in the
    Government, will best ensure the beneficent ends of its institution.</p>
<p class="center">RESOLVED by the Senate and
    House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, two thirds of both Houses
    concurring, that the following Articles be proposed to the Legislatures of the several States, as amendments to
    the Constitution of the United States, all, or any of which Articles, when ratified by three fourths of the said
    Legislatures, to be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution; viz.
</p>
<p class="center">ARTICLES in addition to, and Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America,
    proposed by Congress, and ratified by the Legislatures of the several States, pursuant to the fifth Article of
    the original Constitution.</p>
<p class="center indent">Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg Speaker of the House of Representatives John Adams,
    Vice-President
    of the United States and President of the Senate.</p>
<p class="center">Attest,<br> John Beckley, Clerk of the House of
    Representatives. Sam. A. Otis Secretary of the Senate. *On September 25, 1789, Congress transmitted to the state
    legislatures twelve proposed amendments, two of which, having to do with Congressional representation and
    Congressional pay, were not adopted. The remaining ten amendments became the Bill of Rights.</p>
